# 🚀 Toolos: The User-Centric Operating System

**Toolos** is an independent operating system built with a singular vision: to create an OS that is genuinely **friendly** and **stable**. 

While traditional operating systems often hide behind cryptic hex codes and complex logs, Toolos aims to bridge the gap between human and machine. Every line of code is written with a focus on simplicity, readability, and intuitive design.

## 💎 Core Philosophies

### 1. Transparency
We believe users should always know what’s happening under the hood.
* **Full Visibility:** Toolos provides real-time status updates for all active processes.
* **Contextual Alerts:** Whether an error occurs in the Kernel or User space, the system explains the situation using the **5W1H principle** (Who, When, Where, What, Why, and How).

### 2. Friendliness
Technology should speak your language, not just binary.
* **Human-Readable Errors:** We replace confusing error codes with clear, natural language explanations.
* **Guided Recovery:** Toolos doesn't just report a problem; it guides you through the steps to fix it.

### 3. Safety & Stability
We maintain a rigorous boundary between processes and the Kernel to ensure system integrity.
* **Kernel Protection:** Processes are strictly isolated from the Kernel core.
* **Graceful Panic:** In the event of a Kernel Panic, the system safely unmounts storage and preserves the GOP buffer to display a descriptive "Blue Screen" that informs rather than confuses.

## 🛠 System Overview
* **Architecture:** A purely independent OS—**not** based on Unix, Linux, or Windows.
* **File System:** Adopts a **Unix-style Root Directory** system for efficient and familiar data management.
* **Contribution:** We welcome feedback that aligns with our three pillars: *Transparency, Friendliness, and Safety.*
